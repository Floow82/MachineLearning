# MachineLearning
Machine learning code for dynamic structural analysis.

This code was implemented during a data analysis internship for dynamic materials analysis. It is a deep learning model aimed at recovering the coordinates of an excitation point based solely on the knowledge of two Frequency Response Function (FRF) signals. It utilizes the PyTorch module and consists of a Convolutional Neural Network.
